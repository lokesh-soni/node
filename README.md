# node
My node projects

To run the project go to bin-> www; and run www In cmd "node www".

www is used to make connection with server and calls app.js;
app.js routes the the request to proper pages like about,u,us,use,etc.
pug files are used by respective js files for html ; and js files to the functional part.
Thank you :D
